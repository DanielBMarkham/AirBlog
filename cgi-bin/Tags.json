[Microeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics) analyzes basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and [markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)), their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. [Macroeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics) analyzes the entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, savings, and investment) and issues affecting it, including unemployment of resources (labour, capital, and land), inflation, economic growth, and the public policies that address these issues (monetary, fiscal, and other policies). See [glossary of economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_economics).\n\nOther broad distinctions within economics include those between [positive economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_economics), describing \"what is\", and [normative economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_economics), advocating \"what ought to be\"; between economic theory and [applied economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_economics); between [rational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory)and [behavioural economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_economics); and between [mainstream economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_economics) and [heterodox economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodox_economics).\n\n[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics#cite_note-5)\n\nEconomic analysis can be applied throughout society, in [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_economics), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_economics), [health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_economics), and government.
